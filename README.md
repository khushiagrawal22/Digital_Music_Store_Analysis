# Digital_Music_Store_Analysis_sql

The objective of this project is to analyze and retrieve relevant data from a database related to employees, invoices, customers, genres, tracks, and their respective relationships. The project aims to address various business questions and requirements by formulating SQL queries to extract specific information. The project's objectives can be summarized as follows:

1) Senior Most Employee by Job Title: This query retrieves the first name and job title of the employee with the highest job level.

2) 3Countries with the Most Invoices: This query lists the countries along with the count of invoices, ordered by the invoice count in descending order.

3) Top 3 Values of Total Invoice: This query returns the three highest total invoice values.

4) City with the Highest Sum of Invoice Totals: This query provides the city name and the sum of all invoice totals, sorting the result by the invoice total in descending order and selecting the city with the highest sum.

5) Best Customer by Spending: This query identifies the customer who has spent the most money by summing up their invoice totals and ordering the results in descending order, returning the customer with the highest invoice total.

6) Rock Music Listeners: This query retrieves the email, first name, last name, and genre of all customers who have listened to rock music. The results are ordered alphabetically by email.

7) Top 10 Rock Bands by Track Count: This query returns the artist name and the total track count for the top 10 rock bands. The results are based on the number of tracks each artist has in the rock genre.

8) Tracks with Song Length Longer Than Average: This query retrieves the track names and their durations (in milliseconds) for songs that have a length longer than the average song length. The results are ordered by the song length, with the longest songs listed first.

9) Amount Spent by Each Customer on Artists: This query calculates the amount spent by each customer on artists by summing up the unit price multiplied by the quantity for each track purchased. The results include the customer name, artist name, and the total amount spent, ordered by the total spent in descending order.

10) Most Popular Genre for Each Country: This query determines the most popular music genre for each country based on the highest number of purchases. In cases where multiple genres have the same maximum purchase count, all the genres are included in the results.

11) Top Customer by Spending for Each Country: This query identifies the customer who has spent the most on music for each country. It returns the country, top customer, and the amount they spent. In cases where multiple customers share the top amount spent, all those customers are included in the results.

12) These queries cover various aspects of analyzing and retrieving data related to employees, invoices, customers, genres, and tracks.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide valuable insights into employee hierarchy, customer spending patterns, popular genres, and other relevant metrics. These insights can assist in making data-driven decisions, such as identifying top-performing employees, targeting marketing efforts towards specific genres or countries, and understanding customer preferences and behaviors.
